Workflow state for this spec. Managed by `/flow` — do not edit manually.

- **stepsCompleted**: Which workflow steps are done (e.g. `['step-01-spec', 'step-02-design']`).
- **tasksCompleted**: Which implementation tasks are done (e.g. `['T1', 'T2']`). Tracked per-task during step 4. Reset if tasks are re-created (going back to step 3).
