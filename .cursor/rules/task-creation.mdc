# Task Creation Rules

You are creating a task breakdown document. Follow these rules strictly.

## Required Inputs

Before creating a TASKS.md, you must have:
- Approved DESIGN.md (@specs/XXX/DESIGN.md)
- Approved SPEC.md (@specs/XXX/SPEC.md) — for acceptance criteria traceability
- Access to @.framework/CONSTITUTION.md for project standards

If DESIGN.md is not approved (Status != APPROVED), STOP and inform the user.

## Context Gathering (Before Task Creation)

Do NOT duplicate CONSTITUTION.md or DESIGN.md content into TASKS.md — the developer already loads those documents during implementation. Instead, gather only **genuinely new context** that doesn't exist elsewhere:

### Previous Spec Intelligence

If other spec folders exist in `specs/` (this is not the first spec):
1. Find the most recently completed spec (one with a REVIEW.md that has verdict APPROVED)
2. Read that REVIEW.md — extract: recurring review feedback, patterns flagged, quality issues found
3. Read that spec's TASKS.md Dev Agent Record (if exists) — extract: code patterns established, reuse opportunities, lessons learned
4. Summarize actionable intelligence in the "Previous Spec Learnings" section of TASKS.md

If this is the first spec, write "First spec — no previous learnings available."

### Git History Analysis

If git is available:
1. Check the last 5 commit messages to understand recent work patterns
2. Note: conventions used (naming, structure), libraries added, file organization patterns
3. Include actionable intelligence in the "Previous Spec Learnings" section if relevant

If git is not available, skip this step.

## Template

Always use the template structure from @.framework/templates/TASKS.template.md

## Field Rules

### Metadata
- **ID**: Must match the DESIGN.md ID exactly
- **Name**: Must match the DESIGN.md Name exactly
- Status is always DRAFT until Tech Lead approves
- Author: developer name + "/ AI-assisted" (if name unknown, use "Developer / AI-assisted")
- Date: today's date

### Overview
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Summarize the implementation approach from DESIGN.md
- Do not repeat DESIGN.md content - just reference it

### Tasks
- Each task must be atomic: implementable in a single AI prompt
- Format: `- [ ] T1: [Brief description] (DESIGN: [section/component])`
- Every task MUST reference the relevant DESIGN.md section or component in parentheses
- Order tasks by implementation sequence (dependencies first)
- One task = one component/function/endpoint, not multiple
- If a task feels too big, split it

### Testing (MANDATORY)
- Unit tests are ALWAYS required - never skip
- Create at least one unit test task per major component/function
- Create integration test tasks for flows that span multiple components
- Format: `- [ ] Tx: Unit tests for [specific component/logic]` (continue numbering from last implementation task)
- Integration tests can be marked "No integration tests required." ONLY if DESIGN.md explicitly states this is a purely isolated component
- Reference CONSTITUTION.md for coverage requirements

### Definition of Done
- Keep the standard checklist from template
- Add spec-specific items if needed (e.g., "Documentation updated")

## Task Sizing Guidelines

| Too Big (split it) | Right Size | Too Small (merge it) |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| "Implement user authentication" | "Create login endpoint" | "Add import statement" |
| "Build entire API" | "Implement password validation" | "Write one unit test" |
| "Create database layer" | "Create User repository" | "Add field to model" |

## Constraints

- Do NOT include implementation details (belongs in code)
- Do NOT duplicate DESIGN.md content
- Do NOT skip testing tasks
- Do NOT create tasks that aren't traceable to DESIGN.md
- Do NOT number tests separately - continue task numbering (T1, T2... T5, T6 for tests)
- All bracket placeholders from template must be removed from output

## Validation

Before completing, verify:
- [ ] Every component in DESIGN.md has corresponding task(s)
- [ ] Every task is atomic (one prompt = one task)
- [ ] Testing tasks are present (unit tests mandatory)
- [ ] Tasks are ordered by dependency
- [ ] Definition of Done is complete
- [ ] Status set to DRAFT

## Adversarial Self-Validation

After generating TASKS.md, run this internal check BEFORE presenting to the user:

1. **Reinvention check**: Are any tasks creating functionality that already exists in the codebase? Search for similar functions/modules before assuming new code is needed.
2. **Vagueness check**: Are any task descriptions ambiguous enough that two developers might implement them differently? If yes, make them more specific.
3. **Coverage check**: Does every acceptance criterion from SPEC.md have at least one task that addresses it? Flag any uncovered ACs.
4. **Test coverage check**: Is there a test task for every significant component? Flag components without dedicated test tasks.
5. **Dependency check**: Are tasks ordered correctly? Would any task fail because a prerequisite task hasn't been completed yet?

If any issues are found, fix them in TASKS.md before presenting. Note any significant findings when presenting the document to the user.

## Output

Save the file to: `specs/XXX-{slug}/TASKS.md`

Must be in the same folder as the corresponding SPEC.md and DESIGN.md.
