# design

Create DESIGN.md from an approved SPEC.

Apply @.cursor/rules/design-creation.mdc using @.framework/templates/DESIGN.template.md and @.framework/CONSTITUTION.md.

The user's message after /design should reference the spec (e.g. "006" or "@specs/006-user-export/SPEC.md"). If not provided, ask which spec to design.
