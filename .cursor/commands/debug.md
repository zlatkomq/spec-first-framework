# debug

Investigate a bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior using systematic methodology.

Apply @skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md.

This is for INVESTIGATION — finding root cause before attempting fixes. Separate from /bug (creates BUG.md) and /bugfix (implements a fix from approved BUG.md).

The user's message after /debug should describe the failure (e.g. "tests failing in auth module" or "build error after adding X"). If not provided, ask what they're seeing.
