# tasks

Create TASKS.md from an approved DESIGN.

Apply @skills/task-creation/SKILL.md using @.framework/templates/TASKS.template.md and @.framework/CONSTITUTION.md.

The user's message after /tasks should reference the spec (e.g. "006" or "@specs/006-user-export/DESIGN.md"). If not provided, ask which design to break down.
