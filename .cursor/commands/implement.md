# implement

Implement a specific task from TASKS.md.

Apply @skills/implementation/SKILL.md using @CONSTITUTION.md.

The user's message after /implement should specify the task (e.g. "T3 from 006" or "T1 from @specs/006-user-export/TASKS.md"). If not provided, ask which task to implement.

**Branch management:** This command does not create branches or worktrees. For the full workflow with branch isolation, use `/flow`. This command is a lightweight shortcut for executing a single skill.
