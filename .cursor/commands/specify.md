# specify

Create a SPEC.md for a new feature.

Apply @skills/spec-creation/SKILL.md using @.framework/templates/SPEC.template.md and @.framework/CONSTITUTION.md.

The user's message after /specify is the requirement description. If a spec ID is included (e.g. "006 export users"), use it. If not, ask for one.
